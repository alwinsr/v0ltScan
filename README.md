# Version Disclosure & CVE Mapper

This project is a **Version Disclosure & CVE Mapper** that detects potential version disclosure vulnerabilities and maps them to related CVEs from the MITRE CVE database. It takes a target URL, detects any version disclosures in the HTML source, and maps them to associated CVEs.

## Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python's package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/v0ltScan.git
   cd v0ltScan

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Ensure that requirements.txt contains the necessary dependencies, such as:

beautifulsoup4 for HTML parsing

requests for making HTTP requests

Configuration
Ensure that you have a config.json file in the config directory with the following format:

```
{
    "ndv_api_key": "your_api_key",
    "ndv_api_url": "https://api.ndv.com"
}
